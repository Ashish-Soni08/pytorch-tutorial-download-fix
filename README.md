## 🎯 Problem Solved

The [dynamic quantization tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/dynamic_quantization_tutorial.html) assumed users already had the pretrained model file `word_language_model_quantize.pth` but provided no download instructions, leaving users confused about where to get it.

## ✅ Solution

Added clear download instructions using the official method from PyTorch's Makefile:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/pytorch-tutorial-assets/word_language_model_quantize.pth
```
