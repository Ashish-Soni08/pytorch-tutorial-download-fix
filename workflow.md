## Main Workflow (Steps That Worked)

### 1. Fork the Repository
- Go to https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials
- Click "Fork" button
- Create fork under your account: https://github.com/Ashish-Soni08/tutorials

### 2. Open Codespaces from Your Fork
- Go to your fork: https://github.com/Ashish-Soni08/tutorials
- Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on main"
- This automatically sets up correct remotes and authentication

### 3. Assign the Issue
- Comment `/assigntome` on the original issue

### 4. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b fix-issue-3254-model-download-info
```

### 5. Research the Solution
- Found Makefile reference: https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/main/Makefile#L65-66
- Used same trusted URL as official build system

### 6. Make the Code Changes
- Edit file: `advanced_source/dynamic_quantization_tutorial.py`
- Added download instructions before model loading section:

```python
# **Note:** Before running this tutorial, download the required pretrained model:
#
# .. code::
#
#     wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/pytorch-tutorial-assets/word_language_model_quantize.pth
#
# Place the downloaded file in the data directory or update the model_data_filepath accordingly.
```

### 7. Commit and Push
```bash
git add advanced_source/dynamic_quantization_tutorial.py
git commit -m "Add download instructions for pretrained model in dynamic quantization tutorial

Fixes #3254

- Added wget command to download word_language_model_quantize.pth
- Included note about file placement
- Improved tutorial usability by providing missing download information"

git push origin fix-issue-3254-model-download-info
```

### 8. Create Pull Request
- Used GitHub link provided after push
- Added proper title and description following template
- Referenced Makefile source for credibility
- Added appropriate labels: `docathon-h1-2025`, `easy`

### 9. Respond to Review Feedback
- Received review from [`svekars`](https://github.com/svekars) within 5 minutes of PR submission
- **Feedback:** Change `.. code::` to `.. code-block:: bash` for better Sphinx documentation formatting
- **Action:** Clicked "Commit suggestion" to automatically apply the change
- This shows responsiveness to maintainer feedback and improves documentation quality

### 10. Final Approval and Merge
- Received additional formatting suggestions from reviewer
- **Final outcome:** PR was approved and merged successfully
- **Status:** "1 approving review by reviewers with write access"
- Contribution is now live in the main PyTorch tutorials repository
